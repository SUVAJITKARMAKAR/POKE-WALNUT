## APPROACH TOWARDS THE ASSIGNMENT

`FETCHING THE DATA FROM THE API` : 
Proper utilization fo the PokeAPI in order to fetch data. Implemented API calls using Next.js built-in data fetching methods.

`USER SEARCH FUNCTIONALITY` : 
Integrated a user search bar with search functionality for user to search any Pokemon by name or ID. This allows instant generated feedbacks on valid and invalid searchs.

`PAGINATION ` :
Engineered paginaion feature to allows users to deal with cluttered data into simplified and refreshed manner. This allows the users to browse through lists of pre-fetched Pokemon. Ussed the concept of limits and offset parametrs in order to control the displayed data.

`DISPLAYING THE POKEMON DETAILS` : 
The serach results allows the application to display the Pokemon name, image, abilities and statistics in a responsive layout.



## CHALLENGES FACED

`ERROR-HANDLING` : 
Implemented robust error handling for invalid searchs by the user. Ensured taht inappropriate names or id must be taken into count and provide a user feedback mechanism for invalid searches.

`RESPONSIVE DESIGN LAYOUT` : 
The application was built step by step taking into count of layers and layers of features added along with it's responsiveness.

`PAGINATION LOGIC` : 
Designed an efficinet pagination system that allows seamless browsing of Pokemon was complex yet fun to implement. Balancing the number of display unit/cards was a calculative task.
